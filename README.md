The Jupiter notebooks on this site are for the Fast.ai courses. They are customized for the Google Colab notebook, 
https://colab.research.google.com/, and specifically for the San Ramon BizTech AI meetup, 
https://www.meetup.com/San-Ramon-Professional-Development-Meetup/

The first section is the "Setup (Required)." Please run the three cells in sequence.

The second section is "fetching" the data. You have the option to fetch the data from the Fast.AI URLs 
or data saved on your google drive.

The third section is Fast.ai notebooks. In some cases, they are NOT designed to run sequentially. The goal 
is for you to create your notebooks and use the Fast.ai notebooks as the guide.
