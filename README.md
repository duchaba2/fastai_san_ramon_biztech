The Jupiter notebooks on this site are for the Fast.ai courses. They are customized for the Google Colab notebook, 
https://colab.research.google.com/, and specifically for the San Ramon BizTech AI meetup, 
https://www.meetup.com/San-Ramon-Professional-Development-Meetup/

REMEMBER to "Save copy in drive" before edit it.

The first section is the "Setup (Required)." Please run the three cells in sequence.

The second section or third section is Fast.ai notebooks. In some cases, they are NOT designed to run sequentially. The goal 
is for you to create your notebooks and use the Fast.ai notebooks as the guide.

Happy coding...
